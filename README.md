# MLTSA25_YChen

Reason for taking this class: I have not yet had a class/formal teaching on machine learning, so I would like to know both the background and some of the current models/methdology for machine learning! The research work I am slated to do also can potentially involve machine learning, so that is another reason I would like to take it. I am also aware that machine learning is being applied to many areas outside of physics and is a highly used tool, so I would also like to learn it for this reason. 

What I hope to learn the most: I hope to learn why machine learning is useful and how to pick a good model for the problem I have at hand!

Strengths in background/character: I have some previous computational physics experience, so I am familiar with Python along with some common libraries (i.e. NumPy, PyPlot, SciPy). I would also like to think I am decent at being able to throw myself at a problem until I figure it out...though maybe I might not approach it the best way every time.
