For the autoencoder file, Skyler Lindsey imported data, did initial normalization of the data, and ran the testing and validation training and prediction for the model. 
Jacklyn Clauss helped to debug the normalization of the data and rerun the code, and followed along and learned the code. Yuca Chen and Dayanara Yanez followed along and learned the code. 

For the clustering file, Skyler Lindsey imported data, processed the data to remove NaN and impute values, and did normalization of the data. 
Yuca Chen set up and ran the k-means clustering code and the DBSCAN code, and tested hyperparameter values for the DBSCAN code. 
Jacklyn Clauss helped to test different hyperparameter values for the DBSCAN code. Dayanara Yanez followed along and learned the code.
