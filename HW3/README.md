For ARIMA:

Jacklyn Clauss completed Data Ingestions, including setting up kaggle to obtain the stock information used. Dayanara Yanez completed Data Exploration and all the figures with accompanying captions in the section, outlining the characteristics of the stock data. Skyler Lindsey completed testing each time series for stationarity and obtaining all the partial autocorrelation plots, along with helping to decide what stationarity values to use for fitting the ARIMA models. Yuca Chen fit an ARIMA model to each time series and decided the p-value to use from the produced autocorrelation plots, and completed all the figures with accompanying captions. 

1.   Data Ingestions - Jacklyn
2.   Data Exploration - Daya
3.   Test each time series for stationarity - Skyler
4.   Inspect the Partial Autocorrelation with Plots - Skyler
5.   Fit an ARIMA Model to Each Time Series with Appropriate Parameters - Yuca


For berprophet:

Jacklyn Clauss completed Data Acquisition and Prep and Model 1 of using Prophet (which included model training and validation), along with the accompanying figures and captions. Yuca Chen attempted to import WWO data to use for Model 2, which unfortunately was unsuccessful. Dayanara Yanez completed Model 3 of using Prophet using additional data for fitting (which included model training and validation), along with the accompanying figures and captions.  Skyler Lindsey completed Model 4 of using Prophet with MCMC (which included model training and validation), along with the accompanying figures and captions. 

1.  Data Acquisition & Prep - Jacklyn
2.  Model 1 - Jacklyn
3.  Model 2 - Yuca (attempted but not finished)
4.  Model 3 - Daya
